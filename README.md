<p>
For this lab some sample Support agents and tickets were created to demonstrate the ticket lifecycle. As seen in the above image there are currently three open tickets.

<p>
Clicking on the first one, it brings up the details to begin working it. For this example, we have some sort of business critical outage. This would be something that is highly critical that it is fixed as soon as possible. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
To make sure this one is a high priority and fixed quickly, Priority was changed to "Emergency" and SLA plan was changed to Severity - A which is the highest level for this example that this ticket needs to be dealt with within an hour. It was also assigned to the Level II support team.

<p>
Here is where there is an opportunity to communicate with the user who submitted the ticket. This way they can be updated on the progress being made on their ticket. It is also where the ticket can be designated as "Resolved" or "Closed".
</p>

<p>
After working on the ticket, it was designated as closed and is now under the closed tickets tab for review.
</p>

<p>
For this next one, it is just a password resest request.

<p>
For something minor and easy like this, it can have normal priority, assigned to Level I support and only Severity - C where there are up to eight hours to resolve.
</p>

<p>
As a final note, if you wish to view tickets specifically assigned to you or your team, you can view those under the "My Tickets" tab.
